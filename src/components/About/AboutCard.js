            We are a group of academics dedicated to improve healthcare using technology and innovation, and starting with being grounded in empathy. Our team includes experts in human factors, informatics, nursing, medicine, and research in patient-reported outcomes, sociology, and health services. In addition to our research, Inception Labs runs educational components to develop the next generation of clinicians and engineers devoted toward creating better health experiences through digital transformation.

        <br></br>
Our philosophy, long articulated by <a href="" style={{color:"blueviolet"}}>Dr. Warner Slack,</a> is that the patient (including prospective patient and family) is <a href="" style={{color:"blueviolet"}}> the most underutilized member of the healthcare team.</a>
